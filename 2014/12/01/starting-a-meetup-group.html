          <article>
            <p>In February 2014, after moving to Manhattan and being unable to find
            a New York City network for <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>
            (WWCode), I decided to start one. Ten months later, we have a strong <a href="meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-NYC/">NYC
            network</a> with over 1500 members. We’re
            growing by 50+ members a month and have no signs of losing steam.</p>
            
            <h2 id="what-has-contributed-to-our-success">What has contributed to our success?</h2>
            
            <p>We owe much of our success to our San Francisco-based parent
            organization. They made introductions to technology companies with whom
            they’d already built relationships. The Women Who Code brand was also a
            big advantage. Many of our members and partners already know about our
            organization, and thus are more likely to want to be involved. Not
            every meetup group will have a parent organization, so this is very
            unique.</p>
            
            <p>Another important factor was having a co-founder. Starting a meetup
            group is, of course, a huge commitment. With a co-founder, we can split
            a lot of the work required to organize hosts, speakers, and all the
            email correspondence that comes along with starting a network.</p>
            
            <p>A strong and committed membership base has been vital. Our members want
            to be involved and help. Of course, organizing volunteers (we prefer to
            call them <em>event organizers</em>) is a lot of work, and luckily my co-founder
            is great at this. She quickly scouted event organizers to run our
            Front-End Developer Study Group, which is a popular weekly event.</p>
            
            <h2 id="what-are-our-biggest-challenges">What are our biggest challenges?</h2>
            
            <h3 id="finding-hosts">Finding hosts</h3>
            
            <p>With up to six events a month, finding organizations to host our events
            is possibly the most challenging aspect of running our meetup group.</p>
            
            <p>We found the host for our first event by approaching the organizer of
            another meetup group, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukemelia">Luke Melia</a> of
            <a href="http://www.meetup.com/EmberJS-NYC/">Ember NYC</a>. He was generous and made
            several introductions to the CTOs of NYC-based companies. This helped us
            get the ball rolling.</p>
            
            <p>Being a part of the wider Women Who Code network has obviously helped.
            We get many introductions and leads from our parent organization, our
            advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/sashalaundy">Sasha Laundy</a>, and affiliated
            networks. Our members also help us find hosts—usually their employers or
            friends.</p>
            
            <p>Being part of the WWCode organization combined with our large membership
            means many organizations <em>approach us</em> to host. While we welcome this,
            we tread carefully. For instance, recruiting agencies and for-profit
            educational institutions often want to host us. We always give them a
            shot, but we ensure our members aren’t being targeted too heavily.
            Additionally, we have to be picky about space. If the wifi was
            unavailable for most of the meetup or the environment was simply not
            conducive to productivity, we won’t have an event there again.</p>
            
            <p>Cold calling, mainly on Twitter, is something we often do. We send
            tweets to CTOs, recruiters, and software engineers at various companies.
            This is most successful if the organization has special diversity
            initiatives. For example, the WWCode CEO alerted us to the <a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/announcing-the-fog-creek-fellowship/">Fog Creek
            Fellowship</a>.
            We sent a tweet to a top recruiter there and quickly booked them for a
            Lightning Talks event. However, we’re not always this lucky. Tweets
            sometimes go unanswered and we move on.</p>
            
            <p><img alt="Joel Spolsky gave an entertaining presentation at the Lightning Talks that Fog Creek hosted" src="/images/2014/12/wwcnyc-joel-spolsky.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>LinkedIn has more recently proven to be an important resource. Both my
            co-founder and I get lots of messages from recruiters. If the recruiter
            works at a technology company (versus a recruiting agency), then we ask
            if they might be interested in hosting an event for WWCode. While this
            tactic has only worked 15% of the time, it’s garnered important partners
            like Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
            
            <h3 id="finding-speakers">Finding speakers</h3>
            
            <p>Finding speakers is similar to finding hosts. We find speakers through
            our parent organization, who often recommend potential speakers or make
            introductions. We also encourage our members to speak, especially those
            with interesting side projects or aspirations to become speakers. We
            always invite our hosts to have someone from their organization speak.
            We do our best to keep tabs on people we read about or meet at
            conferences or other meetups, particular those that are NY-based. And
            sometimes women approach us to speak at our events.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, our hosts have been instrumental in finding speakers. For
            example, last Fall we teamed up with Condé Nast for a panel called
            “<a href="http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/180115572/">Finding Your Voice and Bringing Ideas to Life</a>.”
            They found the moderator and most of the panelists.</p>
            
            <h2 id="some-tips">Some tips</h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Get to know your meetup attendees. I ask about the type of
            programming they’re doing, their interests, their personal projects,
            and if they have any feedback.</li>
              <li>Find a co-founder if at all possible to share responsibilities.</li>
              <li>Fill up your meetup calendar with events at least six months out.
            This gives the impression that your group is active and helps potential
            members determine if the group is right for them.</li>
              <li>Book hosts well ahead of time. There’s nothing more stressful than
            trying to find a host for an event that’s just a few days away.</li>
              <li>Always have food at your events. Otherwise, people will arrive late
            or leave early to get dinner.</li>
              <li>Open up RSVPs about 20 days before the date of your event. We made
            the mistake of allowing people to register for all of the events on
            our calendar, including those six months out. These people simply
            forgot about the events, resulting in lower attendance rates.</li>
              <li>Do a head count at every event to find patterns and determine your
            average attendance rate. 50% is typical for us, but it also depends
            on the host. A meetup at Facebook or Fog Creek will have a higher
            attendance rate than one at a lesser known organization. We also
            found that our attendance rates dip in the Fall and Winter, probably
            due to the colder weather and shorter days.</li>
              <li>When approaching potential hosts, keep your email message short
            and to the point. We have a standard template that includes the
            requirements for hosting (space, food, and internet for 20–50 women),
            a list of upcoming events that need hosts, and a sample schedule.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Starting the Women Who Code NYC network is perhaps the most rewarding
            experience I’ve ever had. It’s a lot of work and while it can be
            tiresome, helping women improve their programming and
            tech skills is amazing. I’ve learned a lot about time management
            and event organization, and have met amazing people along the way.</p>

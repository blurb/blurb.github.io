            <h4 id="a-quick-glimpse-into-developer-life-at-blurb">A quick glimpse into developer life at Blurb:</h4>
            
            <p>I get into the office around 9AM and check email (and make my daily
            coffee – can't miss it). Great. I usually spend some time cleaning up
            correspondence between some product owners and our tech leads discussing
            new ideas around new product X or feature Y. A quick scan of New Relic and Airbrake reveal that the site's humming along well.</p>
            
            <p>I log into <a href="http://www.slack.com">Slack</a>, our central communication hub,
            and quickly get a dump of the conversations by our teammates in the
            morning and last night. Surprisingly, something as simple as a central
            chatroom has helped break down some communication walls in our teams.
            Furthermore, having a continual log of team conversations have helped
            our remote workers keep abreast of continual updates.</p>
            
            <h4 id="agile--blurb">Agile @ Blurb</h4>
            
            <p>I log into JIRA and scan the board to check our team status. Looks like
            we still have a lot of in-progress stories. I'm currently not assigned
            anything.</p>
            
            <p>At our daily standup, Chris, a senior engineer on my team, is working on
            story Z. I decide I'm going to ask Chris how he's doing
            and see if I can help.</p>
            
            <p>Chris tells me that he needs some help writing a few tests for his
            feature, so I pull up a chair and we jump right into it – he implements
            the feature, I write the tests. Time passes. We finish our work and we push
            our branch up to the Github server for some code review.</p>
            
            <h4 id="code-reviews">Code reviews</h4>
            
            <p>Code review on our team is done via the pull request system – we ping
            our teammates on Slack and ask for a code review. The comments begin
            flowing in, and we respond.</p>
            
            <p>Simulataneously, we're looking at <a href="http://www.codeclimate.com">Code
            Climate</a> to give us feedback on how our code
            fared against its static analysis tools. Hmm, we seem to have bumped
            code complexity a bit in this class, so let's sit down and refactor some
            more. We push a change and we ask folks in our chatroom to help give
            comments once more.</p>
            
            <p><img alt="Pull requests" src="images/2014/10/sample_pull_request.png" /></p>
            
            <p>(Lunch rolls around. We grab some coworkers to stretch our legs and go to lunch at
            <a href="https://twitter.com/senorsisig">Senor Sisig</a>, which
            is probably the best food truck in the world.)</p>
            
            <p>Our team works on a 2-"+1" code review system. When we make code
            changes, we need at least two other people on the team to approve our
            code. It sounded a little daunting at first, but it's been a good way to
            make sure that the right conversations are happening around the code.</p>
            
            <h4 id="robots-make-life-better">Robots make life better.</h4>
            
            <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot">hubot</a> sits in the chatroom and
            tries to be a little helpful. Here, hubot chimes in and lets us know
            that two people have given their approvals.</p>
            
            <p><img alt="Slack chat #dayinthelife" src="images/2014/10/slack_window.png" /></p>
            
            <h4 id="continous-integration--blurb">Continous integration @ Blurb</h4>
            
            <p>We merge the pull request and wait for Jenkins to run the unit test
            build. We keep a big ol' build light on a bunch of build monitors in our work
            area. If you break the build, the big red light will radiate waves of
            Shame upon you until you fix the build.</p>
            
            <p><img alt="Build light: green is good." src="images/2014/10/build_light.jpg" /></p>
            
            <p>Once the build passes, it automatically deploys the app to an internal
            staging environment – the whole process happens within 15 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Sheree, a test engineer on our team, has already run ahead of us and
            written some RSpec integration tests prior to our implementation. Chris
            has already sat down with Sheree prior to beginning the story and
            defined some of the stories and use cases, BDD-style. We work together
            to get the integration tests running and working.</p>
            
            <h4 id="all-in-a-days-work">All in a day's work.</h4>
            
            <p>A big reason I enjoy working here is because our daily development
            workflow encourages teamwork and collaboration, and you can get feedback
            on your changes very quickly. And we're making it better! Stay tuned as
            we continue to write more about our engineering practices.</p>

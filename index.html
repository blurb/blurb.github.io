                <p>You're at your friend's house, chillin', maybe watching something on the
                TV, when suddenly you're hit with inspiration. "OH MY GOD, THAT'S THE
                PERFECT STARTUP IDEA!" you think. Visions of Sand Hill dance through
                your head as you envision the world changed by your brilliant new idea
                for a social network for crows, but there is one problem. You left your
                computer at home. You ask to borrow your buddy's machine, but you find
                it unusable. You sit there, staring blankly at a command line, filled
                with gibberish.</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Command line gibberish" src="images/2014/11/commandline.png" /></p>
                
                <p>You turn to your friend. "Uhhhhâ€¦. how do I get an editor?" A flurry of
                random letters, and you're in vim. But something's wrong. DVORAK!</p>
                
                <p>Has this ever happened to you? If so, you've fallen victim to someone
                else's over-customized environment! But don't despair. I'm here to show
                you some useful ones.</p>
                
                <h4 id="why-customize-or-vanilla-bash-oughtta-be-good-enough-for-everyone">Why Customize? (or, Vanilla Bash Oughtta Be Good Enough For Everyone)</h4>
                
                <p>Three reasons: efficiency, comfort, and developer happiness. All three of
                these come together to let you be more productive. Having an
                environment that you're comfortable in, that empowers you to do things
                more easily, and that removes your pain points, will help you in the
                long run. A well-configured environment will give you two kinds of
                efficiencies:</p>
                
                <p>The first kind of efficiency is the straightforward automation
                efficiency that engineers work all day to create for businesses. It's
                the kind of automation talked about in one of my favourite XKCDs:</p>
                
                <p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1205/"> <img alt="Is it worth the
                time?" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" /></a></p>
                
                <p>You might think it is a waste of time to customize your tools. Maybe you
                think you're getting things done fast enough as it is. But you're
                probably blind to just how many times you do a given thing. Even if you
                shave 10 seconds a day off of your interactions with Git, how many times
                do you commit in a day? (hint: it should be a lot). Take, for example,
                my usage graph from <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (more on this
                later)</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Twenty Times A Day" src="images/2014/11/alfred.png" /></p>
                
                <p>According to the XKCD graph, using Alfred 20 times a day, assuming the
                smallest possible time gain (1 second), entitles me to work on it for
                approximately 10 hours before I break even. Consider, then, that I've
                been carrying most of these customizations with me since college, and
                I've already shaved a <em>full day</em> off of executing programs that the rest
                of you are spending clicking through Finder. </p>
                
                <p>However, the second kind of efficiency is the more important one. I'm
                sure that you've heard of "flow" before.
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> is the state of
                mind in which you're fully engaged on the task at hand, bringing to bear
                the full might of your impression mental faculties. Flow is the
                difference between killing an hour on
                <a href="http://reddit.com/r/roombaww">r/roombaww</a> waiting for 5PM, and missing
                your train because woah how'd it get to be 8PM, oh heck did I forget to
                eat dinner again? Flow is where you do your best work, and as an
                engineer, you should prioritize getting into it as much as possible,
                every day. </p>
                
                <p>One of the biggest enemies of flow is interruption. Ask most engineers
                about this, and they're likely to tell you about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">all the ways in which
                Management interrupts them and wastes their
                time</a>. But this is not
                the most common interruption. The most common interruptions are the
                small ones. The five- or ten-second cognitive delays you have to make in
                tricky situations when you drop out of autopilot and have to think
                "<a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/529623481592586242">What's the syntax for ln
                again?</a>".
                Seriously. Every single time I'm making a symlink I have to do the same
                thing:</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Source Target" src="images/2014/11/symlink-syntax.png" /></p>
                
                <p>And then, I <a href="2014/11/cat.jpg">cat</a> both foo and bar
                just to make absolutely sure that they both contain "foo". 
                "That's right. It's source <em>then</em> target. I'll never forget again. Until
                next week.</p>
                
                <p>By customizing your environment, you can remove as many of those
                potential future ln -s's out of your path right now. You can replace
                long, involved commands with shorter, more automatic keystrokes. You
                can make aliases for complex or often-error'd interactions. Each of
                these steps may on its own seem pointless, but the sum of all the
                individual optimizations is a more frictionless working environment. </p>
                
                <h4 id="alright-show-me-what-you-got">Alright. Show Me What You Got</h4>
                
                <p>By now you should be sold on the virtues of making your environment your
                own. By the time you're done with it, it should be as comfortable as
                Homer Simpson's Butt Groove</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Butt Groove" src="images/2014/11/butt-groove.jpg" /></p>
                
                <p>But where should you start? Well, I started by borrowing from my
                friend's customizations, so in the interest of paying it forward, I'll
                share my l33t environment haxxz. </p>
                
                <p>Unless otherwise stated, all of the following customizations are
                available at <a href="http://github.com/eqdw/dotfiles">my Dotfiles repo on
                Github</a></p>
                
                <h4 id="the-command-prompt">The Command Prompt</h4>
                
                <p>I use a custom prompt generator for my prompt. This is primarily because
                implementing it in shell script was too slow. However, this has made it
                portable, and as I've moved from Bash to Zsh to Fish, this has been
                helpful. </p>
                
                <p>My terminal is generated by a program called <a href="http://github.com/eqdw/wunderprompt">Wunderprompt, available on
                my Github</a>. </p>
                
                <p><img alt="Example prompt" src="images/2014/11/example-prompt.png" /></p>
                
                <p>This is an example of my prompt. There is a lot of information packed
                into this.</p>
                
                <p>First, "source". This is the name of the current directory. It is colour
                coded based on which server I'm on. I currently have it set up as
                follows: <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> denotes my work machine.
                <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span> is my personal laptop. <span style="color:magenta">Magenta</span> is the terminal on my website, and
                everything else defaults to <span style="color:red">Red</span>. Ever
                accidentally run a command on prod? I won't; I can check the colour of
                the path. </p>
                
                <p>The next section is git info. It begins with a nag counter. The red 2h
                means it has been 2 hours since my last commit. This starts as a green 0
                and slowly counts up minutes. At 30 minutes it turns yellow. Two hours,
                red. Above two hours it stops displaying minutes and starts displaying
                the count in hours. And above 24 hours, in days. A friendly reminder to
                commit early and often.</p>
                
                <p>Next, 'env-post', refers to the current branch. This will be * for
                master, and otherwise the branch name. In this case, I'm on the env-post
                branch of our blog repo. The branch name will be green for a clean
                branch, and magenta otherwise.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of branch cleanliness, env-post is magenta. The reason is the
                next few characters. They give me an at-a-glance idea of the current
                branch status. The D means a file was deleted. The A means a file was
                added. The ? means there are unstaged changes. And the 7 counts the
                total number of changes that a <code>git status</code> would return. </p>
                
                <p>The last element of the prompt is the %. This tells me I'm <em>not</em> a
                superuser. If I was logged in as root, it would be a # instead. It's
                green. This means the last command was successful. If it was not, it
                would be red, and prefixed with the exit code from the failing command.  </p>
                
                <h4 id="shell-customizations">Shell Customizations</h4>
                
                <p>I use the <a href="http://fishshell.com/">Fish shell</a> for my work. This is a
                shell with a much friendlier working environment. On the one hand, this
                means it's not encumbered by 30 years of UNIX baggage. On the other
                hand, it is <em>not</em> Bash compatible, so I often have to debug little
                issues with install scripts. In any case, I have a large number of shell
                modifications , which you can find in ` .config/fish/fish.config ` in my
                dotfiles repo. I'd like to highlight a few of my more common
                optimizations here</p>
                
                <p>Near the top, I have a 'misc' section. It has some useful commands</p>
                
                <p><code>function def</code> Used as <code>% def foo</code>, this does a full text search of the current dir and
                all subdirs for a ruby method definition of the passed in method (in
                this case, 'foo'). Useful to find where some code is defined</p>
                
                <p><code>function pyserv</code> This creates a simple http server in the current
                directory, serving up the files. It has its uses, if nothing else, as an
                easy way to fileshare on a local network. </p>
                
                <p><code>function psag</code> This runs the process list and searches it for a
                given string.</p>
                
                <p><code>the 'u' functions</code> "cd .." is a weird way to go <em>u</em>p one level. "cd
                ../../../../../.." is a weird way to go <em>uuuuuu</em>p six levels</p>
                
                <p><code>tarx</code> and <code>tarc</code> Tar, like ln, is lost arcana, known only to the last
                remaining Level 27 Unix Masters. Well, until I wrote down the most
                common way to <em>c</em>reate and e<em>x</em>tract tarballs</p>
                
                <p><code>function ls</code> I override ls with gnu ls and several custom flags.</p>
                
                <p>Without this:
                <img alt="Boring ls" src="images/2014/11/boring-ls.png" /></p>
                
                <p>With this:
                <img alt="Fun ls" src="images/2014/11/fun-ls.png" /></p>
                
                <h5 id="bundler-and-rails-section">Bundler and rails section</h5>
                
                <p>Most of these commands are shortenings of normal usage. A few stand out</p>
                
                <p><code>function bers</code> and <code>function berc</code> Rails 2 invokves commands via <code>script/foo</code>. Rails 3+
                use <code>rails foo</code>. This is my attempt to harmonize both. </p>
                
                <p><code>function rRg</code> Ever wanted to search for a specific route? Grep the
                output of rake routes</p>
                
                <p><code>function rlc</code> and <code>function rlv</code> Will grep the server output for words
                that indicate controllers and views respectively. Useful for tracking
                down execution in unfamiliar code</p>
                
                <h5 id="git-section">Git section</h5>
                
                <p>There's a lot of writing on the internet about how the basic interface
                to git is mega confusing. I agree. That's why I made my own. Common
                operations get their own three (or sometimes four) -letter shortcuts. My
                normal workflow consists of the following:</p>
                
                <p><code>gcom</code> (git checkout master). <code>gpum</code> (git pull upstream master). <code>gps</code>
                (git push (to my branch)). <code>gcob WT-1234</code> (git checkout -b with the name
                of whatever jira ticket). And so on and so on. </p>
                
                <p>Finally, I have several local customizations for ssh'ing into work
                machines (sorry, the details are secret). I don't type <code>ssh
                username@sillynamingconvention.12.23.32.232.blurb.com</code>, I simply type

                <p>I use Vim as my standard editor, along with Yehuda Katz'
                <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> framework. I don't use the
                majority of the extensions (I don't even know what they are!) but I'm
                slowly learning them. Most of them are commonsense things that I would
                go looking for anyway. Check it out for details!</p>

                <p>I mentioned above, I use a launcher program called <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>
                to manage most of my gui workflows. At first glance, it looks like
                nothing more than a replacement for OSX's spotlight, but it is much,
                much more. I don't even use it to the full extent; I mainly use it for
                invoking programs, switching windows, and controlling my music. A simple
                tap on âŒ˜-space brings up the Alfred window, where I can type a few
                characters and it will intelligently fuzzy-match it to recently used
                commands.</p>
                
                <p><img alt="Alfred" src="images/2014/11/alfred-launcher.png" /></p>
                
                <p>I also use it to control my music. By typing 'it' I activate the itunes
                client, which lets me do a bunch of things, most with a single text
                command</p>

                <p>Alfred comes with a visual scripting environment that lets you make all
                kinds of custom control scripts. Maybe some day I'll make some of them.
                For example, I've a friend who has Alfred scripts to control his Rails
                development environments. It's saved him oodles of time!</p>

                <p>One final technique I've come across is abusing search shortcuts.
                Nominally a search shortcut is just that: say I type "wikipedia" in the
                url bar, that tells the browser to search wikipedia with whatever else
                I type. But how does it do this? By crafting the correct query URL on
                wikipedia. For instance, searching Google for "test" really just means 
                navigating to http://google.com/search?q=test. Using this lets me abuse
                this functionality on other sites. For instance, I have every repo at
                work set up to let me effortlessly search for a commit on github. If I
                type <code>&lt;repo&gt; &lt;sha&gt;</code> it will expand to <code>http://&lt;internal
                git&gt;/therd/&lt;repo&gt;/commit/&lt;sha&gt;</code>, showing me the commit I want. I've set
                up a similar tool for Jira tickets. </p>

                <p>I get into the office around 9AM and check email (and make my daily
                coffee â€“ can't miss it). Great. I usually spend some time cleaning up
                correspondence between some product owners and our tech leads discussing
                new ideas around new product X or feature Y. A quick scan of New Relic and Airbrake reveal that the site's humming along well.</p>
                
                <p>I log into <a href="http://www.slack.com">Slack</a>, our central communication hub,
                and quickly get a dump of the conversations by our teammates in the

                chatroom has helped break down some communication walls in our teams.
                Furthermore, having a continual log of team conversations have helped

                <p>I log into JIRA and scan the board to check our team status. Looks like
                we still have a lot of in-progress stories. I'm currently not assigned
                anything.</p>

                feature, so I pull up a chair and we jump right into it â€“ he implements
                the feature, I write the tests. Time passes. We finish our work and we push

                <p>Simulataneously, we're looking at <a href="http://www.codeclimate.com">Code

                <p>Ember's handlebars helpers don't like having too many arguments (it allows you to have one argument and an options hash). It also doesn't like nested calls, such as having one helper that takes the result of another helper as an argument. </p>
                
                <p>A while ago, we added a helper method for i18n-js that allows us to translate things in the view layer. In order to make the helper method handle string interpolation with nested translations (for example: translating "If you want to learn more, click #{here}", and then <code>here</code> is itself a translated link to somewhere), we make the translate helper recognize a special suffix. We called it <code>Key</code>, so any translation key that ends in <code>Key</code> represents a nested translation (such as <code>hereKey</code> for the earlier example).</p>
                
                <p>Then, we translate the key before passing it in for string interpolation as part of the original translation.</p>
                
                <p>The final method looks like this:</p>

                <p>We also had some trouble using the message field in ember-validations, as it overwrites i18n and appeared to be setting the message value before we set our i18n-js locale, causing all our error messages to be stuck in english.</p>
                
                <p>We fixed it by changing the message from trying to translate the string to just returning the translation key and changing the view accordingly to handle the translation there instead.</p>

                </h6>
                <p>This builds off the sideloading <code>ApplicationSerializer</code> introduced in <a href="http://mozmonkey.com/2013/12/loading-json-with-embedded-records-into-ember-data-1-0-0-beta/">this article</a> and adapts it to handle JSON objects that don't have "id" as their primary key. Several instances where this might come up are when handling currencies or countries.</p>
                
                <p>Let's start with data that looks like:</p>
                
                <p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/majone/3/embed?js">Sample Data</a></p>
                
                <p>If we import this using the previously defined sideloading serializer, we end up with four currencies, each with a generated id, which can quickly start to clutter our store when we start handling dozens or hundreds of prices in multiple different currencies.</p>
                
                <p>In order to fix this, we need to look at the <code>sideloadItem</code> method. </p>
                
                <p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/jises/6/embed?js#J:L14-20">Original</a></p>
                
                <p><code>primaryKey</code> in this case is always set to "id", because <code>this</code> in our case refers to the <code>ApplicationSerializer</code> rather than the serializer for <code>item</code>. Ember Data always needs an id for its records, so what we can do instead of letting each currency generate a new one is set the id here based on some other primary key.</p>
                
                <p>At this point, <code>type</code> is the class of the item (<code>App.Currency</code>) and <code>item</code> is the payload of the json, which should look something like this (note that it hasn't been run through the serializer for its class yet):</p>
                
                <pre><code>{  iso_id: "USD", symbol: "$", delimiter: "," }
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>So what we can do is shove an id into the item before pushing it into the sideload array, by checking to see if the class has a nonstandard primary key that we want to store as the id of the item.</p>
                
                <p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/jises/5/embed?js#J:L17-20">new</a></p>
                
                <p>And to set the <code>rawPrimaryKey</code> (raw because we want the key the json gives us, because we haven't yet normalized it to the class's actual ) as a class attribute, we need to reopen the it, as so:</p>
                
                <pre><code>App.Currency.reopenClass({   rawPrimaryKey: "iso_id" })
                </code></pre>
                
                <p>Now, loading the data gives us four prices and two currencies, with the added bonus that comparing the currencies of two prices with the same currency should now work as expected without needing a custom compare method.</p>

                  <p>Last April, I presented at the <a href="https://twitter.com/EmberNYC">Ember NYC meetup</a>
                to discuss different approaches for sorting an ArrayController. This is a
                short synopsis, you can learn more in the meetup video and slides.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>To sort an Ember <code>ArrayController</code> you may have used the included
                SortableMixin <code>sortProperties</code> and <code>sortAscending</code> properties. These
                are great and work really well for sorting on one property or sorting on
                multiple properties all in the <em>same direction</em>. But that's a huge caveat,
                <code>SortableMixin</code> does not allow you to sort by multiple properties in different
                directions.</p>
                
                <p>For example, suppose you have a list of books you want to display, with the
                most recent at the top. Using the <code>SortableMixin</code>, this is done by setting
                <code>sortProperties</code> and <code>sortAscending</code>, and then referencing the <code>arrangedContent</code>
                property in our template or view:</p>
                
                <p><a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/nibiq/latest/embed?js">Ember Starter Kit</a></p>
                
                <p>While <code>sortProperties</code> lets us specify more than one property to order by, you'll notice
                <code>sortAscending</code> is a boolean value and gets applied to <em>all</em> properties.
                But what if we wanted to sort by the publish date first in descending order,
                then by title in ascending order? We're unable to sort in different directions without applying a custom
                sort function (which can get cumbersome).</p>

                <p>The Computed Property Macros have several methods for creating common types
                of computed properties. <code>Ember.computed.sort</code> allows us to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Sort properties by different criteria</li>
                  <li>Use a custom comparison function when needed</li>
                  <li>Sort by computed properties</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><code>Ember.computed.sort</code>  has two parameters:</p>
                
                <ol>
                  <li><code>dependentKey</code>: a reference to the content we're sorting</li>
                  <li><code>sortDefinition</code>: either a string referencing the property key containing the sort definition or a custom sort function</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>In the example below, <code>sortDefinition</code> is the property key <code>propertiesToSortBy</code>,
                which is an array of property keys and the corresponding sort direction. By
                default, properties are sorted in ascending order, but by appending ":desc" to the
                key we can change the sort direction. This allows to specify a different
                sort direction for each property:</p>

                <p>Your template or view will need to reference <code>sortedBooks</code> to reflect the
                sorted content. <a href="http://emberjs.jsbin.com/fidiy/6/edit?html,js,output">See the complete JS Bin example</a>.</p>
